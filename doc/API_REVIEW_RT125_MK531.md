        Part 1 (Mark)
        What about your API/design is intended to be flexible?

        Created API/classes for multiple classes such that


        How is your API/design encapsulating your implementation decisions?

        Encapsulates decisions because the main view window can handle any arbitrary windows that are placed on it due to hierarchy. They handle very general input types.

        What exceptions (error cases) might occur in your part and how will you handle them (or not, by throwing)?

        Catches syntax errors thrown by backend to display on error sheet.


        Why do you think your API/design is good (also define what your measure of good is)?

        Because they are very flexible to the implementation decisions of the backend and are able to extend the API to fit their needs.

        Both people should complete Part 1 before continuing on to Part 2.

        Part 2

        How do you think Design Patterns are currently represented in the design or could be used to help improve the design?

        What feature/design problem are you most excited to work on?

        What feature/design problem are you most worried about working on?

        Come up with at least five use cases for your part (it is absolutely fine if they are useful for both teams).
